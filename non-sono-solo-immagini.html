                <p>With this project, I aimed to address the urgent issue of image-based sexual abuse, specifically the non-consensual distribution and/or creation of private sexual material. My research explored how digital platforms like 4chan and Telegram facilitate these abuses and the distinct languages used.</p>
                <p>In “Non <i>sono solo immagini</i>,” I sought to shift the narrative surrounding image-based sexual abuse by focusing on perpetrators rather than victims. This approach aims to counteract victim-blaming and raise awareness about the diverse and violent practices involved. The project culminated in a website featuring data visualizations that translate my research findings into accessible, impactful digital artifacts.</p>
                <p>These artifacts include a catalog of abusive requests from Telegram groups and a glossary of image manipulation terms used on 4chan. Through this project, I combined communication design and social advocacy to create a powerful tool for education and change, highlighting the real and harmful nature of this violence.</p>

              <h3>Context</h3>
              <p>
                For my MSc final research project, I chose to address an urgent social issue enabled by digital technology, merging my interest in online spaces and behaviors with critical gender-related challenges. I focused on image-based sexual abuse, the non-consensual distribution and/or creation of private sexual material. This form of gendered violence occurs daily within vast online communities, primarily affecting unaware victims. When these acts make the news, the focus is often on the survivors, leading to victim-blaming similar to other forms of gender violence.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-10 col-xl-10 offset-xl-1 offset-md-1 text-progetto">
              <p>
                To define the context, I conducted an extensive literature review on image-based sexual abuse, sexual violence, gender violence, and gender and internet studies. I then examined media representation and victim-blaming dynamics, concluding that mainstream discussions, with their focus on survivors and sensationalizing language, perpetuate harmful stereotypes. There is an urgent need to shift the focus to the perpetrators to combat these damaging narratives.
              </p>

              <p>
                While studying the practices of image-based sexual abuse and the role of platforms in facilitating them, I noticed that the language used in these communities was particularly distinct. This observation led me to focus my project on the online vernacular language—the unique expressions and styles of digital communities.

                My research project was led by three fundamental research questions: How and on which digital platforms is image-based sexual abuse practiced? What are the practices and vernacular languages of image-based sexual abuse online? How can the vernacular languages of image-based sexual abuse found in the research phase be visualized?

                Data and findings from research questions 2 and 5 served as the starting material to create the dissemination artifact, as they both involved an in-depth thematic analysis of conversations between perpetrators on both platforms. I decided to create a website due to the “onlineliness” of the subject itself, the versatility of the medium, and its potential to reach a wider audience.

                The first artifact is the catalogue, which displays 313 requests for images and/or videos constituting image-based sexual abuse made by members of four Telegram groups active in the Italian pornography subculture. These requests are visually rendered as postcards, displayed in a visualization where the filter buttons also serve as a legend. The background color represents the proposed action, such as material exchange or discussion. Each solid shape represents the subject requested, whether it's a partner, ex, or parent, with the shape's color denoting the subject's gender. If specified, the outlined shape symbolizes the content genre, such as rape or child pornography.

                The second artifact is the glossary, which showcases the most frequently used terms by 4chan users when requesting the manipulation of material to make it sexually explicit. These manipulations are presented like a card index, with each manipulation detailed in a file containing its definition, variants, related terms, and examples. This index also functions as a word cloud, organizing terms based on their frequency of use. The color of each file represents the type of manipulation requested, such as altering the subject, relocating it in another image, or depicting a specific action within the image.

                I achieved a more effective and just approach to addressing the issue of image-based sexual abuse by shifting the perspective from victims to perpetrators, making clear and visible the violence behind the practice and its gendered nature. Through “Non sono solo immagini,” I created awareness and education about image-based sexual abuse to initiate a critical discussion and drive change. I successfully combined communication design methods with social advocacy to create a useful, functional, and recognizable tool. Ultimately, 'Non sono solo immagini' received positive feedback during my MSc dissertation, earning the highest score.
