                <p style="margin-bottom: 5vh;">"Making the Invisible Visible" is a collaborative digital project where my team and I explored online image censorship through innovative visualizations. We investigated how platforms and governments control or remove content, focusing on themes such as censorship of artists on social media, gender disparities in censorship, and self-censorship practices by erotic magazines on Instagram. Through eight tailored research questions, we combined data analysis with custom visualizations to reveal patterns and impacts of censorship, presenting these insights on an interactive website. Our project received praise for its novel approach and engaging presentation, effectively highlighting the complexities of online content regulation.</p>

              <h3>Context</h3>
              <p>
                Before starting this project, we were asked to pick a topic from a list. We chose online censorship, specifically of images, as it presented an interesting opportunity for qualitative research.
              </p>
            </div>

              <p>
                Online censorship involves controlling or removing specific public content by governments or platforms aiming to regulate it. As visual content production grows exponentially, these policies have become increasingly detailed and numerous. This phenomenon impacts more users, raising significant questions: Why is some content censored? Who is responsible for the censorship? Where is the boundary between appropriate and inappropriate content? Censorship can sometimes act silently, leaving users unaware, while at other times it is blatantly evident, prompting users to seek ways to respond or bypass it.

                I began by collecting censored artwork and artist names from the first 100 relevant Google results.

I then created an image database of the artists’ works or specific artworks from Wikimedia or Google Images.

                I designed the visualization to resemble an archive, where each self-censored picture is represented by a small rectangle, grouped by magazine, and colored according to the censorship technique.

This visualization aimed to immediately show which magazines had the most self-censored images and the most used techniques.

                “Making the Invisible Visible” effectively showcases our research findings, providing users with an interactive and engaging way to explore the complexities of online censorship. We received positive feedback highlighting the novelty of our research questions and findings, which made people think about themes and issues they had not previously considered. Research on censorship in Google Maps and erotic magazines’ self-censorship was particularly appreciated for their unique insights and innovative visualizations.
