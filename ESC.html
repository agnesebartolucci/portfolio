                <p>The project aimed to create an interactive narrative—a digital experience where users influence a storyline through their actions—by transmedially translating the novel <i>Petronius</i> by Marcel Schwob. Hence, ”Esc” is a Location-Based Mobile Game (LBMG) composed of physical and digital media, designed to encourage university students to explore the university area and experience it as a vibrant neighborhood with places waiting to be discovered.</p>
                <p>Players, assuming the role of the main character, utilize an app and a daily wrecking journal to immerse themselves in the narrative, interacting with it through meaningful choices that dictate different routes and endings. The theme of discovery, central to the original work, is reimagined using escape as a metaphor, encouraging users to explore their surroundings and engage with physical environments. This theme is emphasized throughout, guiding users to uncover hidden gems in the city's often-overlooked areas.</p>
                <p>The narrative unfolds in episodes, where the protagonist's dialogues and actions, involving choices or actions by the users, are pivotal for the story's progression. In various locations, users encounter artifacts crucial for advancing the game.</p>

              <p><b>My contribution:</b>  working on "Esc" was incredibly enjoyable, especially since it was set in our university neighborhood. I contributed to the concept and storytelling, developed and wrote lines for a character, and devised all the routes in the neighborhood. Regarding graphic design, I played a role in shaping the project's visual identity. Additionally, I crafted various artifacts for the journal and riddles, such as maps, articles, and postcards. Furthermore, I handled the on-site aspects, designing every poster, flyer, or sticker the user encounters along the way.</p>

              <div><p><i>"Esc" was developed to uphold the original values, themes, and main characters of the story while also introducing new elements to expand the narrative universe. The game adapts the novel into an alternate reality, preserving the main characters but renaming them as Petronio and Sirio. The use of the journal medium mirrors Petronius' passion for writing. Central to the story is the theme of the desire to escape to discover something new, meet new people, and embark on new adventures. This theme is emphasized throughout the narrative, serving as its guiding principle.</i></p></div>

              <div><p><i>The story is set in a mildly dystopian Italy in 2020, following a fictional educational reform enacted in 2002. The university gained autonomy in self-regulation, establishing a system where discipline, rigor, and seriousness reign as central values. It shapes students' educational paths and aims to standardize their thinking. This environment starkly contrasts with the suburbs, where self-expression and diversity are celebrated.</i></p></div>

Following this is the journal, which users utilize to record vital information, solve riddles and minigames, access a map for navigation, and consult rules governing the use of provided media. Additionally, the visual novel takes the form of a mobile app, employing a geolocation system to unlock various scenes. Each scene features photos, dialogues, and multiple choices leading to different endings. Supplementary content, including newspaper articles, character cards, and Instagram profiles, enhances user immersion in the narrative.</i></p></div>
